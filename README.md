About Manager
============
This is a React Native application where managers of a business can manage their employees. 
Managers are able to add new employees and include their name, phone number, and their next shift that they work. 
Managers can also edit, fire, and text their employees.

This is my fourth and final React Native application that I created by following along Stephen Grider's course on Udemy "**The Complete React Native and Redux Course**".
